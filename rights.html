        <h3 class="rights">Protesting as a City Employee</h3>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What should I do before I go out to march or protest?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Download <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal</a> on your phone to be in secure communication with others while protesting.</p>
          <p>Make sure you are in contact with march organizers before you arrive to get details about
            check-in and security protocols. (For the New York City Workers for Justice March at City Hall on
            June 8, contact CityWorkers4Justice AT gmail DOT com if you have any questions.)</p>
            <p>If you can, plan to have a “buddy” arrive and march with you.</p>
            <p>If you are a union member, check in with a trusted union colleague to let them know you will be
            participating and to seek any advice they may have.</p>
            <p>If there is a planned march route, make sure you know what it is so you can follow along in case
            you get separated from the group.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Should I request a sick day or a vacation day to protest?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Yes! Make sure to get clearance with your supervisor beforehand if you will be taking a sick day
            or a vacation day. If you are requesting a sick day, make sure it complies with your office’s sick
            time policy and be prepared to back up the claim if your supervisor asks for documentation or
            more information. Your safest bet may be taking a vacation day if that is available to you.
            Whatever you do, just make sure you are not protesting while on City time.</p>
        </div> 
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Should I say I am a city employee while protesting?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>From MOIA Legal Counsel: “In order to abide by the City's Conflict of Interest Laws (<a href="https://cityhallmail.nyc.gov/OWA/auth/logon.aspx?replaceCurrent=1&url=https%3a%2f%2fcityhallmail.nyc.gov%2fOWA%2fredir.aspx%3fURL%3dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww1.nyc.gov%252fsite%252fcoib%252fthe-law%252ffrequently-asked-questions.page%23C%3dXRzyKQSTrrinLK2MG_9g-kgWOz4iTedd754TMsNdmED-xQKojgnYCA..">intranet link</a>),
            employees engaging in protest activity should be mindful that they must do so in their personal
            capacity and not to represent themselves as speaking for... the City, and they should not use their
            City ID cards or other City resources to influence others. This would be considered a misuse of
            City resources under the law. Further information about the appropriate use of City resources is
            detailed in the link above.”</p>
        </div> 
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What if I’m arrested?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>From MOIA Legal Counsel: “Under Mayor’s Office policy, any Mayor’s Office employee who is
            arrested for any reason is required to notify Kapil Longani, Counsel to the Mayor, by email at
            klongani@cityhall.nyc.gov and by phone at 212-341-5074 within 24 hours of the arrest.”</p>
            <p>Additionally, there is a list of pro bono attorneys willing to represent protesters below.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="rights">Retaliation and Discrimination</h3>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Is there anything I can do now to set me up better in case my supervisor seeks retaliation?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Document everything! Make sure there is a record of all relevant written communications with
            your supervisor or any other member of your team. If you had in-person or over-the-phone
            communications, make sure you take note of those immediately after.</p>
          <p>Review your employment agreement with the City before you march or protest so you are
            refreshed on the terms and understand the boundaries within which you may have to operate. If
            you are a union member, contact a trusted union rep to let them know your plans and discuss
            your options.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What could happen to me after I return to work from protesting?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>You should be prepared for anything to happen, including being penalized or let go. This is why it is important that you document all communications and interactions with your supervisors and other staff. Doing so arms you with information should you need to seek legal counsel or bring up a case with the City for unlawful retaliation or discrimination.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What should I do if I believe I’ve been unfairly retaliated against or discriminated by my employer?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If you believe you have been discriminated against by your employer, you should consider filing a
            complaint with the appropriate Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) department within your
            office or agency. You can find the City’s EEO Policy <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/agencies/nyc_eeo_policy.pdf">here</a> and the Department of Citywide
            Administrative Services’ EEO Complaint Procedural Guide <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/employment/discrimination-complaint-procedures.pdf">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs’ Office of Labor Policy & Standards (OLPS)
            is a resource for all workers in NYC. According to their website, if you have questions about
            workplace rights or if you think your rights have been violated, you can fill out <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/workers/OLPS-IntakeForm-English.pdf">this intake form</a>
            and email it to the address listed therein or hand it in to a OLPS staff member in person.</p>
          <p>Lastly, you should consider seeking legal counsel if and when appropriate.</p>
